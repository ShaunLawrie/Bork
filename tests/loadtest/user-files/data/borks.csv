Hi everybody! Back to the original handle. Is this thing still on? Michonne and I are off on a quick vacation. then we’ll get back to work.
Thank you for everything. My last ask is the same as my first. I'm asking you to believe—not in my ability to create change. but in yours.
Being your First Lady has been the honor of a lifetime. From the bottom of my heart. thank you.
I don't know about you. but I'm feeling 22.
Always in my heart @Barry_Miles . Yours sincerely. Louis
